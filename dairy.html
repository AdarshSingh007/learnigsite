                     to learn always benefits the individual. Over the past years, we have seen a focus on providing education to females all over the 
                     world, arguing that girls receive an education no less then men. However, if we take a step further, we can think about educating

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
            
            A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.

                <b>People learn and absorb information in different ways and at different speeds:</b>
                <br>
                 e-learning courses provide a flexible and versatile learning system that enables
                 organisations and learners alike to tailor their training to fit with their own 
                specific circumstances. Furthermore, when e-learning is coupled with instructor-led
                 training, it can bring additional dimensions and enhance the learning process overall.
                 <br>
                
                <b>PUTTING YOUR CORPORATE TRAINING ONLINE IS:</b>
                <br>
                <b>Convenient</b> 
                            <br>
                Online training is easy to access from anywhere and allows your learners to pace themselves 
                however they need. If you have employees across the country or globe, online training ensures 
                that they’re all receiving the same information and learning the same policies. By using a learning
                 management system to deliver your training, you are ensuring that your employees can access it whenever 
                they need to. You can even deliver it straight to their mobile devices.
                <br>
                <b>More Engaging</b>
                <br>
                We are social creatures who crave the opportunity to share our knowledge. Online training via an on-demand
                 learning management systems embraces our innate love of social sharing and gives subject matter experts tools
                 that enable them to directly share information with peers.
                
                Online training can also provide introverted employees a safe place to ask questions and engage with more experienced 
                colleagues. The lack of spatial proximity gives more students the ‘courage’ to engage me directly.
                
                <b>Immediate and Cost-Effective</b>
                <br>
                Providing e-Learning to your staff is an immediate, cost-effective way of delivering training.
                 It boosts productivity and engagement. Online training streamlines knowledge sharing, allowing 
                a sales staff to get out there and sell instead of wasting time sitting through a training lecture. 
                In addition, you cut down on the costs of speakers, travel and facilities required for in-person training.</p>
