       <b><i> An online class is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a
         learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress,
          as well as communicate with fellow students and their course instructor.
           <br>
        Online classes are generally self-paced, allowing for greater flexibility in completing coursework.
         Some examples of online courses are MOOCs, or Massive Open Online Courses, as produced by organizations 
         such as edX or Coursera. Many traditional universities offer online courses, including Purdue University 
         via their takeover of Kaplan.
        
        When it comes to student success, community is everything. Introducing our Community, a tool designed to
         build connections in and out of class.

        the most complex subjects in a very clear 
        and understanding way makes the faculty of Matrix, the best team under one roof. All the members of the faculty team
